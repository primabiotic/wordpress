1) The following terms and conditions apply to contracts that you enter into with us as a provider (Natur Bay GmbH) via the website https://primabiotic.de. The customer's own conditions may not be included unless otherwise agreed.

(2) In accordance with the following provisions, a consumer is any natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes which cannot be predominantly attributed to either his commercial or  independent professional activity.

Our offers on the Internet are non-binding and not a binding offer to conclude a contract.

(2) You can submit a binding purchase offer (order) via the online shopping cart system.
Here, the goods meant for purchase are stored in the ‘Shopping cart’. You can use the respective button in the navigation bar to access the “shopping cart” and make changes at any time. After accessing the "checkout" page and entering the personal data and the payment and shipping conditions, all order data are finally displayed again on the order overview page.
Before submitting the order, you have the option of changing or checking the details in the order overview again (also via the "back" function of the web browser), or cancelling the order.
When the order is placed using the “place order with liability to pay” button, you submit a binding offer to us.
You will first receive an automatic e-mail about the receipt of your order, which does not yet lead to the conclusion of the contract.

(3) The acceptance of the offer (and thus the conclusion of the contract) takes place within 2 days by confirmation in text form (e.g. e-mail), in which the execution of the order or delivery of the goods is confirmed to you (order confirmation).
If you have not received such a message, you are no longer bound by your order. In this case, any services that have already been provided will be reimbursed without delay.

(4) The order will be processed and all the necessary contract-related information will be sent by e-mail in a partially automated manner. Therefore, you are required to ensure that the e-mail address you have provided to us is correct, that the receipt of the e-mails is technically guaranteed and, in particular, that it is not prevented by SPAM filters.

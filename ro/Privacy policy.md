2. Purposes of data use, legal basis and our legitimate interests

The use of this website is possible without providing any personal data. Where such data is collected, the following shall apply:

a. Collection of general data and information and its purpose

This website collects general data and information each time it is accessed. We store it in the so-called log files of the server. The following may be recorded:

- the types and versions of browsers you use, together with information about the type and type of your display device

- your operating system,

- the website from which you access our website (so-called referrer),

- the sub-internet pages which are accessed via an accessing system on our website,

- the date and time of your visit to our website,

- your Internet Protocol (IP) address,

- your internet service provider and

- other similar data and information that serve to prevent and defend against attacks on our IT systems.

We do not draw any conclusions about your person from this data and information. We need this information in order to display our website correctly, to ensure the functionality of our IT-systems and our website, and to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of criminal offences. Furthermore, this is also a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR, which, if necessary, constitutes the legal basis for any data processing of personal data in this context.

We store the anonymous data of the server log files separately from any personal data entered by you.

b. Collection of personal data and its purpose

There are various ways to contact us on our website. For example, you can contact us via the e-mail address we provide or use a contact form or corresponding function for this purpose. When you contact us in this way, we store the personal data you enter. The data collected in each case is determined by the type of communication or the fields of the form used.

Such data voluntarily submitted by you will be stored by us for the purpose of processing your enquiries and/or contacting you. We do not disclose personal data to third parties. When contacting us, data is collected in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 b) GDPR. It is then necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. If a contract is concluded, the data is also collected in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 b) GDPR.

If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing under the provisions set out above, we will obtain your consent. In such cases, Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR is the legal basis for the data processing.

c. Registration

You can register on our website by providing personal data. In doing so, you transmit to us the data resulting from the respective input field required for registration. This is only processed for internal purposes. It is used to offer content or services that can only be offered to registered users (e.g. simplified ordering process). This constitutes a legitimate interest and the data is therefore processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR processed. Furthermore, it serves the initiation and processing of contracts, which enables processing pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 b) GDPR. By registering, you also agree to the use of this data. This data is therefore also processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR.

When you register, your IP address and the date and time of registration are also stored. The processing of this data serves to prevent misuse of our services and, if necessary, enables the investigation of criminal offences. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR, which is the legal basis for data processing in this context.

d. Data transmission to third parties

Personal data will only be passed on by us if this is necessary for the processing of contracts concluded with you. In this way, the data can be passed on to delivery, drop shipping, IT and payment service providers. Any further disclosure will not take place.

The legal basis in such cases is Art. 6 para. 1 b) GDPR. According to this, the processing of data for the fulfilment of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures is permissible.

There shall be no transfer to third countries other than Canada. The EU Commission has issued an adequacy decision for data transfers to Canada.  

e. automated decision-making

Automated decision-making or profiling does not take place.

3. 3.	Duration of storage

We only store your personal data for as long as we are obliged to do so due to corresponding legal regulations (e.g. tax laws). After the expiry of the relevant retention period, we routinely delete the corresponding data if it is no longer required for the fulfilment or initiation of the contract. If the storage purpose ceases to apply before the expiry of a statutory retention period, we delete the corresponding data immediately. If we have to delete data because you have exercised your rights of intervention, this will also be done immediately.

4. Your rights

a. Right to confirmation (Art. 15 GDPR)

You have the right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing personal data relating to you. Corresponding enquiries should be addressed to us. If you make the relevant request electronically, the information shall be provided by us in a commonly used electronic format unless you specify otherwise.

b. Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)

If personal data relating to you is processed by us, you have the right to receive from us at any time, free of charge, information about the personal data stored about you and a copy of this data. You can also request information about the following from us:

- the processing purposes;

- the categories of personal data being processed;

- the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or are still being disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;

- If possible, the planned duration for which the personal data will be stored or, if this is not possible, the criteria for determining this period;

- the existence of a right to rectification or deletion of personal data concerning you or to restriction of processing by us or a right to object to such processing;

- the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;

- where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to the source of the data;

- the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, in accordance with Art. 22 1 and 4 GDPR and - at least in these cases - meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and intended effects of such processing for you.

You also have the right to know if we transfer personal data to a third country or to an international organisation. If we do so, you have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer.

You can contact us at any time to exercise the aforementioned rights to information. If you make the relevant request electronically, the information shall be provided by us in a commonly used electronic format unless you specify otherwise.

c. Right of rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)

You have the right to request the rectification without delay of inaccurate personal data concerning you and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, the completion of incomplete personal data, including by means of a supplementary declaration. Corresponding enquiries should be addressed to us. 

d. Right to deletion (right to be forgotten) (Art. 17 GDPR)

You may request that the data controller deletes the personal data concerning you without delay if one of the following reasons applies:

- the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;

- You withdraw your consent on which the processing is based pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 a) GDPR and there is no other legal basis for the processing;

- You submit an objection to the processing according to Art. 21 Para. (1) GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for such processing, or you object to the processing of your data pursuant to Article 21 (2) GDPR;

- the personal data has been processed unlawfully;

- the deletion of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law to which we are subject; or

- the personal data has been processed in relation to information society services offered in accordance with Art. 8 (2). (1) GDPR.

If one of the above reasons applies and you would like us to delete personal data, you can contact us at any time.

e. Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)

You have the right to ask us to restrict processing if one of the following conditions is met:

- the accuracy of the personal data is contested by you for a period of time that enables us to verify the accuracy of the personal data;

- the processing is unlawful, you object to the deletion of the personal data and instead request the restriction of use of the personal data;

- we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you need it for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims; or

- You have objected to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 1 GDPR and it is not yet clear whether our legitimate reasons outweigh yours.

If one of the aforementioned reasons exists and you would therefore like to request the restriction of the processing of your data, you can contact us at any time.

Where processing has been restricted by us, we may process such personal data - apart from storing it - only with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of substantial public interest of the Union or a Member State.

f. Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)

You have the right to obtain your personal data, which you have provided to the controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transfer this data to third parties without hindrance from us, provided that the processing is based on consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR or Art. 9 para. (2)(a) GDPR, or on a contract in accordance with Art. 6 1 b) GDPR and the processing is carried out with the aid of automated procedures. Furthermore, you have the right to request that the personal data be transferred directly from us to third parties, if this is technically feasible and if this does not affect the rights and freedoms of other persons.

These rights do not apply if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.

To assert the right to data portability, you can contact us at any time.

g. Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)

You have the right to object, at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data carried out on the basis of Art. 6 1 e) or f) GDPR.

We will no longer process the personal data in the event of objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.

If personal data is processed for the purpose of direct advertising, you can also object to this at any time. We will then no longer process your data for this purpose.

In addition, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is carried out by us for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89, para. 1 GDPR, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest.

To exercise your right to object, you can contact us at any time. You may also exercise your right to object in relation to the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.

h. Right to withdraw consent under Art. 7 para. 1 P. 1 GDPR

You have the right to revoke consent to the processing of personal data at any time. You can send us notifications to this effect. A revocation does not affect the lawfulness of the data processing carried out until its receipt.

i. Right to appeal (Art. 77 GDPR)

You have the right to lodge complaints with the competent supervisory authority at any time. To do so, you must contact them. The following authority is responsible for us:

5.	Further information

Please note that the provision of personal data is sometimes required by law (e.g. tax laws) and/or may result from contractual obligations (e.g. data of the contractual partner). It is also necessary for the conclusion of a contract.

You only need to provide us with personal data if you want to contact us or conclude a contract with us. If you do not provide us with data in such cases, we will not be able to contact you and conclude any contracts.

6. Cookies

Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are placed and stored on a computer system via an internet browser. Many websites and servers use cookies. The use of cookies on our site opens up opportunities for us to make the use of our site more user-friendly. Without cookies we would not have these opportunities.

Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. This is a unique identifier of the cookie, which consists of a string of characters. This enables internet pages and servers to be assigned to the internet browser in which the cookie was stored. These assigned Internet pages and servers can then recognise and identify a specific Internet browser via the unique cookie ID and thereby distinguish it from other browsers. For example, the user of such a website then does not have to enter his or her access data again every time he or she accesses the page. This is done automatically via the corresponding function of the website and the cookie stored in the browser. The following link provides you with detailed information on the cookies set by this site and allows you to withdraw any consent you have already given.

Cookie settings - Show details

You can also prevent cookies from being set by our website at any time by setting your internet browser accordingly. By doing so, you permanently object to the setting of cookies. You can delete cookies that have already been set at any time using the corresponding functions of your Internet browser or other corresponding programs. If you use this option, this may limit the functionality of our website.

The data transmitted by cookies, if required for the display of our website or for functions used by you, is processed in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 f) GDPR, which is the legal basis for the data processing in this context. We have a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of our website. In all other cases, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR (your consent).

7. Contact form

If you use our contact form to get in touch with us, we will store your details from the form with us to enable us to process your enquiry and answer it as well as any queries you may have. By using the contact form you agree to this. You can revoke this consent informally (e.g. by e-mail) at any time. The processing of data in this context is based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR. We do not pass this data on to third parties without your consent.

8. Newsletter

We offer a newsletter on our website. If you would like to receive this, we require an e-mail address from you and further information by means of which we can verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided. You must enter this data via the corresponding form. If you do so and order the newsletter, you consent to the processing of this data. We only process this data for the purpose of sending the newsletter and do not pass it on to third parties.

When you register for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the system you are using at the time of registration, as assigned by your internet service provider (ISP), as well as the date and time of registration. We need this data to be able to clarify any cases of abuse at a later date. This serves our safeguarding purposes and is in our legitimate interest. The data is therefore processed in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 f) GDPR.

The legal basis for the processing of the data you have entered is the consent you have given by subscribing to the newsletter in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 a) GDPR. You can revoke this informally at any time, for example by using the unsubscribe link in every newsletter e-mail. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter. The data processed until revocation shall be deemed to be lawfully processed even after such revocation. We store the data you provide when ordering the newsletter until you unsubscribe. After unsubscribing from the newsletter, we delete the data. Such data, which was also stored by us for other purposes, is not affected by this.

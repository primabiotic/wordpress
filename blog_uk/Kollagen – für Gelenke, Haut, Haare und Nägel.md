<h3>Collagen - a food supplement for your joints, skin, hair and nails!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>What distinguishes the collagen supplement? It actually has a double effect. On the one hand, we can count on the improvement of our well-being and the relief of joint and muscle pain, on the other hand, collagen is like a beauty injection, as it has a strong effect on skin, hair and nails.</em></p>

<h3>Is collagen supplementation beneficial?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one of the most frequently asked questions in connection with collagen. The intake of food supplements is recommended for all persons over 26 years of age. More or less from that moment on, the production of the protein in our body slows down significantly, which manifests itself in the form of wrinkles or loss of firmness in the skin. The biggest doubt, however, is whether the collagen can be assimilated and have an effect on our mood or appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The assimilability of collagen from food (e.g. jellies) is very low and is often estimated at up to 5%. Hydrolysed collagen has a distinct advantage. It consists of short, bioactive peptides which, under the influence of hydrochloric acid, are transformed into amino acids that are only absorbed in the small intestine. From there, they are transported together with the blood to the systems, organs and tissues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We should therefore bear in mind that collagen supplementation is beneficial as long as we choose a hydrolysed product.</p>

<h3>Collagen - a food supplement for your joints</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Protein is the building block for bones, joints and cartilage. As we age, as mentioned earlier, we lose the ability to rebuild collagen fibres. Cartilage becomes less elastic and less synovial fluid - the substance that reduces friction during movement - can be produced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All this together leads to us feeling pain during simple activities. Our knees creak when we climb the stairs, gardening takes its toll on our shoulders, more and more often we complain of pain in our elbows or wrists... Going to a specialist is one option, but we can also help the body ourselves. How? Through proper nutrition and the intake of hydrolysed collagen in the form of food supplements.</p>

<h3>Beautiful skin, hair and nails - the importance of collagen for our appearance</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as our joints, bones and cartilage weaken with age, so does the condition of our hair, skin and nails. We can see it with the naked eye - when we get up, the dents on our cheeks from the pillow don&#39;t tend to disappear as quickly, the hair thins, the nails break and splinter. Very often, exercise is no longer as effective. Cellulite on the thighs or buttocks is very resistant and does not want to disappear despite all efforts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, there are some basic factors to consider: a diet rich in vitamins C and E, drinking water and external care. However, one very important piece of the puzzle that makes up our beautiful appearance and better mood is - once again - collagen. Regular intake of this protein strengthens the skin, makes wrinkles less visible and allows new wrinkles to appear later. We also stop losing hair and our nails grow faster and harder.</p>

<p><strong>Collagen - a need-based supplement or a fad? Many independent studies show that supplementation with collagen protein is very important to eliminate musculoskeletal complaints. It also helps you look more radiant.</strong>Â </p>
